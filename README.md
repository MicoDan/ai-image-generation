MERN AI Image Generation Project
-

The MERN AI Image Generation project is a full-stack web application that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to generate images based on user input or specific criteria. The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), which provides a robust and scalable foundation for developing modern web applications with AI capabilities.

Features
-
AI-powered image generation based on user input or selected parameters.
Option to choose from different AI models for image generation.
Real-time previews of generated images.
Save and download the generated images.
User authentication and authorization to access advanced features.
Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.


Technologies Used
-
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data and generated images.
Express: A flexible and minimalistic web application framework for Node.js.
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment.


Run the development server and client concurrently:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open your browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Folder Structure
-
client: Contains the frontend code (React).
server: Contains the backend code (Node.js and Express).
